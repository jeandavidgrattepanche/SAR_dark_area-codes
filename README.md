# SAR_dark_area-codes
These are the scripts used for the paper "Microbial diversity in the eukaryotic SAR clade: Illuminating the darkness between morphology and molecular data" published in BioEssays in 2018.

The script used the taxonomy from OTT, create a taxonomic tree, look if species are present in NCBI (i.e., if sequence data exists), used metadata from NCBI and create a distribution map.
